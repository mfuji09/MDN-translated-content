HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) **`502 Bad Gateway`** 에러 응답코드는, 서버가 게이트웨이나 프록시 서버 역할을 하면서 업스트림 서버로부터 유효하지 않은 응답을 받았다는 것을 가르킨다.

> **참고:**A [Gateway](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EA%B2%8C%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8%EC%9B%A8%EC%9D%B4) might refer to different things in networking and a 502 error is usually not something you can fix, but requires a fix by the web server or the proxies you are trying to get access through.
