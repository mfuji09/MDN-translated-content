{{DefaultAPISidebar("High Resolution Time")}}

**High Resolution Time** 規格は、アプリケーション内でクライアント側の待ち時間測定をサポートする {{domxref("Performance")}} インターフェイスを定義しています。{{domxref("Performance")}} インターフェイスは 1000 分の 1 ミリ秒の精度であるため、高解像度と見なされます (ハードウェアまたはソフトウェアの制約を受けます)。これらのインターフェイスは、フレームレートの計算 (アニメーションでは潜在的に重要) やベンチマーク (リソースのロード時間など) を含む、さまざまな使用例をサポートしています。

Since a platform's _system clock_ is subject to various _skews_ (such as NTP adjustments), the interfaces support a _monotonic clock_ i.e. a clock that is always increasing. As such, the `Performance` API defines a {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} type rather than using the {{jsxref("Date.now","Date.now()")}} interface.

## DOMHighResTimeStamp

The {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} type, as its name implies, represents a high resolution point in time. This type is a `double` and is used by the performance interfaces. The value could be a discrete point in time or the difference in time between two discrete points in time.

The unit of `DOMHighResTimeStamp` is milliseconds and should be accurate to 5 µs (microseconds). However, If the browser is unable to provide a time value accurate to 5 microseconds (because, for example, due to hardware or software constraints), the browser can represent a the value as a time in milliseconds accurate to a millisecond.

## メソッド

The `{{domxref("Performance")}}` interface has two methods. The {{domxref("Performance.now","now()")}} method returns a {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} whose value that depends on the {{domxref("PerformanceTiming.navigationStart","navigation start")}} and scope. If the scope is a window, the value is the time the browser context was created and if the scope is a {{domxref("Worker","worker")}}, the value is the time the worker was created.

The {{domxref("Performance.toJSON","toJSON()")}} method returns a serialization of the {{domxref("Performance")}} object, for those attributes that can be serialized.

## プロパティ

The `{{domxref("Performance")}}` interface has two properties. The {{domxref("Performance.timing","timing")}} property returns a {{domxref("PerformanceTiming")}} object containing latency-related performance information such as the start of navigation time, start and end times for redirects, start and end times for responses, etc.

The `{{domxref("Performance.navigation","navigation")}}` property returns a {{domxref("PerformanceNavigation")}} object representing the type of navigation that occurs in the given browsing context, such as the page was navigated to from history, the page was navigated to by following a link, etc.

## インターフェイス

- {{domxref('Performance')}}
  - : Provides methods and properties containing timing-related performance information for the given page.
- {{domxref('PerformanceEntry')}}
  - : Provides methods and properties the encapsulate a single performance metric that is part of the performance timeline.
- {{domxref('PerformanceFrameTiming')}}
  - : Provides methods and properties containing frame timing data about the browser's event loop.
- {{domxref('PerformanceMark')}}
  - : An abstract interface for [`performance entries`](/ja/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry) with an [`entry type`](/ja/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry/entryType) of "`mark`". Entries of this type are created by calling [`performance.mark()`](/ja/docs/Web/API/Performance/mark) to add a named [`DOMHighResTimeStamp`](/ja/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp) (the mark) to the browser's performance timeline.
- {{domxref('PerformanceMeasure')}}
  - : An abstract interface for [`performance entries`](/ja/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry) with an [`entry type`](/ja/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry/entryType) of "`measure`". Entries of this type are created by calling [`performance.measure()`](/ja/docs/Web/API/Performance/measure) to add a named[`DOMHighResTimeStamp`](/ja/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp) (the measure) between two marks to the browser's performance timeline.
- {{domxref('PerformanceNavigationTiming')}}
  - : Provides methods and properties to store and retrieve [`high resolution timestamps`](/ja/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp) or metrics regarding the browser's document navigation events.
- {{domxref('PerformanceObserver')}}
  - : Provides methods and properties used to observe performance measurement events and be notified of new [performance entries](/ja/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry) as they are recorded in the browser's performance timeline.
- {{domxref('PerformanceResourceTiming')}}
  - : Provides methods and properties for retrieving and analyzing detailed network timing data regarding the loading of an application's resources.

## 実装状況

As shown in the {{domxref("Performance")}} interface's [Browser Compatibility](/ja/docs/Web/API/Performance#Browser_compatibility) table, most of these interfaces are broadly implemented by desktop browsers.

To test your browser's support for the {{domxref("Performance")}} interface, run the [`perf-api-support`](http://mdn.github.io/web-performance/perf-api-support.html) application.
