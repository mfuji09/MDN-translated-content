The {{jsxref("Reflect")}} object, introduced in ES2015, is a built-in object that provides methods to interface with JavaScript objects. Some of the static functions that exist on `Reflect` also correspond to methods available on {{jsxref("Object")}}, which predates ES2015. Although some of the methods appear to be similar in their behavior, there are often subtle differences between them.

The table below details the differences between the methods available on the `Object` and `Reflect` APIs. Please note that if a method does not exist in an API, it is marked as N/A.

| Method Name                   | `Object`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | `Reflect`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `getOwnPropertyDescriptor()`  | {{jsxref("Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()")}} returns a property descriptor of the given property if it exists on the object argument passed in, and returns `undefined` if it does not exist. However, if an object is not passed in as the first argument, it will be coerced into an object. | {{jsxref("Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()")}} returns a property descriptor of the given property if it exists on the object. Returns `undefined` if it does not exist, and a `TypeError` if anything other than an object (a primitive) is passed in as the first argument.                                                 |

| `getPrototypeOf()`            | {{jsxref("Object.getPrototypeOf()")}} returns the prototype of the given object. Returns `null` if there are no inherited properties.

| `setPrototypeOf()`            | {{jsxref("Object.setPrototypeOf()")}} returns the object itself if its prototype was set successfully. Throws a `TypeError` if the prototype being set was anything other than an `Object` or `null`, or if the prototype for the object being modified is non-extensible.                              | {{jsxref("Reflect.setPrototypeOf()")}} returns `true` if the prototype was successfully set on the object and `false` if it wasn't (including if the prototype is non-extensible).

| `isExtensible()`              | {{jsxref("Object.isExtensible()")}} returns `true` if the object is extensible, and `false` if it is not.

In ES2015, it will be coerced into a non-extensible, ordinary object and will return `false`.             | {{jsxref("Reflect.isExtensible()")}} returns `true` if the object is extensible, and `false` if it is not.

| `preventExtensions()`         | {{jsxref("Object.preventExtensions()")}} returns the object that is being made non-extensible. Throws a `TypeError`in ES5 if the argument is not an object (a primitive). In ES2015, treats the argument as a non-extensible, ordinary object and returns the object itself.                           | {{jsxref("Reflect.preventExtensions()")}} returns `true` if the object has been made non-extensible, and `false` if it has not.

| `keys()`                      | {{jsxref("Object.keys()")}} returns an `Array` of strings that map to the target object's own (enumerable) property keys.
